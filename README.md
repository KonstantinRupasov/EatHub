Agile Recipe Development and Production

- Developing a food recipie is an iterative process that includes a lot of tries and errors. There seems to be no app aimed at automating it:
    - Please point me into the direction of this kind of apps out there if you seen any
- During my home cook "carier" I developed dozens of recipies and always thought I could benefit from some kind of Agile automation.
- This repository is my first attemt to create a prototype of such an app

Main focus of the app:

- JSON-based language allowing to define the recipie
- Git-based version control
- Virtual agile "pipline" for recipies:
  - Versions
  - Releases
  - Release types:
    - Prototype
    - Canditate
    - Prod
    - etc.
- Interactive engiune that "runs" recipies:
  - Guides you through the recipie step by step
  - Gives you instructions of what to do on each step
  - Allows to run several independent threads for a single recipie (if you have several cooks working at the same time)
  - Allows to run multiple recipies at the same time
  - Automatically spreads the workload between your team members

Use cases:

- Test kitched or a restaurant developing a recipie
- Restaurant, running multiple concurent preparations at the same time
